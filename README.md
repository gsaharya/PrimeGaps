# PrimeGaps
Parallel Programming
A C script which finds the largest gap between two consecutive integers in range [a, b].
How it works:

Each processor gets a range of numbers to work on
This allows for more work to be done simultaneously
One single processor can then decide the results after a data structure is populated
